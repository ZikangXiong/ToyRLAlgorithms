# Toy RL Algorithms
![logo](assets/logo.png)  

A collection of pytorch implementation of basic reinforcement learning algorithms. 
This repository aims to provide readable code and help understand the details and small ticks used in reinforcement learning algorithms. 
The implementation is not suitable for any production environment or large scale experiments. 

If you are looking for take-and-use code, these repositories will be helpful.  
- [baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines/): Openai RL algorithm implementation.
- [stable-baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines): More user-friendly implementation comparing with baselines. 
- [stable-baselines zoo](https://github.com/araffin/rl-baselines-zoo): A collection of pretrained RL agents
- [stable-baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3): PyTorch implementation of stable-baselines
- [ray/rllib](https://github.com/ray-project/ray): Large scale training and turning.
